# Change Log

### v5.2.2:
    1. Add curl-cffi compatability

### v5.2.1:
##### Fix
    1. Solve the problem that Windows cannot terminate the process by Ctrl+C
    2. Print information error

### v5.2.0:
##### New Features
    1. Added `--php` parameter. By default, it is judged based on the URL set by --url whether the .php suffix uses the PHP connection method. In special cases, you can manually use --php to specify the PHP connection method.

### v5.1.0:
##### New Features
    1. Add `--request-template` parameter to set request template to avoid traffic detection
##### Fix
    1. Updated documentation for `-r` parameter

### v5.0.2:
##### Enhancement
    1. Support for php < 5.4 (special thanks to @me1ons for issue #82)
#####  Fix
    1. Fix the situation where php does not support `php://input` in some environments and cannot be used normally

### v5.0.1:
##### Enhancement
    1. Java improves compatibility through reflection, such as tomcat10 cannot be used (special thanks to @BeichenDream for PR)
    2. Use class static variables instead of `application` global variables to improve compatibility (special thanks to @c0ny1 for his suggestion)
##### Fix
    1. When repairing the abnormal connection, it failed to exit normally
    2. Fix exception handling logic of `blv_decode` (issue #73)

### v5.0.0:
##### New Features
    1. Both java/chsarp/php use the `BLV (Byte-Length-Value)` data structure for transmission, officially removing the random header technology that has been used since the first version was released three years ago
    2. Under the `BLV` data structure, implement a request retry mechanism, which can overcome harsh environments (such as server instability, load balancing, and only some servers are deployed on some machines, etc.)
    3. A new golang server is added, which supports starting a new process to provide services, in order to solve the more severe special environment :) (Special thanks to @M09Ic for solving io blocking and other problems)
    4. Add `-R/--force-redirect` parameter option to solve the `islocal()` detection for java, resulting in the service that cannot be forwarded to the local machine, and added the force forwarding function
    5. Add `--max-retry` parameter option, which can control the number of retries of Neoreg
##### Enhancement
    1. Simplify the use, `tunnel.jsp(x)` has achieved the best compatibility, and this version starts to remove `tunnel_compatibility.jsp(x)` 2. Java uses Gzip compression instead, and jsp(x) is compressed, and the file 30% smaller in size
    3. PHP modified the position of `set_time_limit(0)` to make the request time other than CONNECT more stable and reliable
    4. Java has set the connect timeout to 3 seconds to ensure stability and improve concurrent speed under extreme network conditions (special thanks to @c0ny1 for his solution)
    5. csharp set the connect timeout to 2 seconds to ensure stability and improve concurrent speed under extreme network conditions
    6. Client log output redesign and optimization
##### fix
    1. The banner is changed to base64, which makes `-f FILE` more usable
    2. Fix the problem that php cannot work normally when the downstream traffic is too large
    3. Fix the failure of php to output other subsequent content normally due to `exit`
    4. Fix `-k KEY` special key can not be used normally

### v4.0.0:
